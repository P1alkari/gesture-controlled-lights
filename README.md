# Hand Tracking LED Control with Arduino & Python

This project demonstrates a **real-time computer vision to hardware pipeline** where hand gestures detected using a webcam control LEDs on an Arduino via serial communication.

The goal of the project is to showcase skills in **Python, computer vision, serial communication, and embedded systems**, while keeping the system modular and easy to extend.

## 🚀 Features

* Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**
* Robust finger-count detection with temporal smoothing
* Serial communication between Python and Arduino
* LED output mapped directly to finger count
* Clean and beginner-friendly project structure

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. MediaPipe tracks one hand from the webcam
2. Finger states are detected and smoothed over time
3. The finger count is sent as a single character (`'0'–'5'`) via serial
4. Arduino reads the value and turns on the first **N LEDs**
